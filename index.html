                <p>
                    <strong>Guessing Difficulty</strong>: Measures how resistant your password is to brute-force guessing. Longer passwords generally take more time to crack, so this score improves with length. <br>
                    <strong>Uncommonness</strong>: Evaluates how diverse your character selection is. Using a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols makes it harder to predict. <br>
                    <strong>Cracking Difficulty</strong>: Based on entropy — a measure of unpredictability. The higher the entropy, the stronger the resistance to dictionary or rainbow table attacks. <br>
                    <strong>Overall Strength</strong>: A combined evaluation of the above, giving you a simple snapshot of your password’s real-world strength.
